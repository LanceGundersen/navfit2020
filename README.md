### Features

- Cross Platform Installers: The primary goal is to provide a solid tool that works across all modern devices a Sailor has at their disposal. NavFit2020 aims to support MacOS, Windows 10, and Linux.
- Form Filler: To keep out of the business of modifing official U.S. Navy documentation NavFit's goal is to essentially fill out the existing official documents only.
- Text based database: One of the downfalls to the legacy version of NavFit is that it required another piece of software that was critical to the software architecture. To solve this, NavFit leverages the tried and true JSON document standard. This means it can be extended upon and leveraged by other tools and it's simply just text. You can leverage existing U.S. Navy tooling to store, share, and encrypt this database through official channels.
